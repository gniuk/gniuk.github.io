        <h1>A comfortable keyboard layout for both desktop and laptop, and both Vim and Emacs.</h1>

            The Ctrls are at the best position. Whether you use an external keyboard or use the embedded<br>
            keyboard of a laptop, you work in a uniform way with this keyboard layout. You don't have<br>
            to press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key with your palm or pinky, you don't need the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to play a dual role.</p>
        <p style="font-size:24px;">
            With a software dual key setup, we can make the<kbd> ; </kbd> key serving as <kbd>Alt</kbd> when holding on, so our<br>
            hands are at the home row most of the time when typing or editing. The <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> may also<br>
            serve as a dual role key or map to <kbd>Esc</kbd> as you like.<br>
            The <kbd>Tab</kbd> and the<kbd> [ </kbd> key may serve as <kbd>Win</kbd> when holding on. Convenient when using tilling<br>
            window managers such as i3wm or sway which use the Win key as mode key.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:24px;">
        My right thumb hurts after pressing a heavy Space key and bending over to press the Alt key<br>
        for nearly six months. So the heavy <kbd>Space</kbd> key gets smaller and is splitted into two parts in this<br>
        keyboard layout.
